This Simulink model shows a portable charging circuit that can be used to charge a battery electric vehicle (BEV) in case there are no BEV charging stations nearby.


A bucl converter charging circuit is used to charge the BEV through the external portable charging device. The Buck converter operates with a current control mechanism such that the BEV can be charged safely to prevent damage. The current at which the BEV is charging at is 50A, which is a bit higher than usual. However, this is intentionally designed as the user probably wants the BEV to charge very quickly so that he can get to the closest charging station as soon as possible.
